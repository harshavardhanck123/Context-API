# React useContext Cart Management App

This React application demonstrates the use of the `useContext` hook combined with the `useReducer` hook to manage and manipulate cart data. The project fetches JSON data from a provided URL to create a dynamic cart page displaying each item's price, quantity, and total amount, with the ability to adjust quantities interactively.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to obtain a copy of the project and run it on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (typically installed with Node.js)

### Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash

   ```bash
   cd react-usecontext-cart
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash

## Functionality

- **Load Cart Data**: Automatically loads JSON data for cart items from a remote source.
